NAME
  iceprog - simple programming tool for FTDI-based Lattice iCE programmers

SYNOPSIS
  iceprog [options] <filename>

DESCRIPTION

Notes for iCEstick (iCE40HX-1k devel board):

  An unmodified iCEstick can only be programmed via the serial flash.
  Direct programming of the SRAM is not supported. For direct SRAM
  programming the flash chip and one zero ohm resistor must be desoldered
  and the FT2232H SI pin must be connected to the iCE SPI_SI pin, as shown
  in this picture: http://www.clifford.at/gallery/2014-elektronik/IMG_20141115_183838


Notes for the iCE40-HX8K Breakout Board:

  Make sure that the jumper settings on the board match the selected
  mode (SRAM or FLASH). See the iCE40-HX8K user manual for details.


OPTIONS

    -d <device-string>  use the specified USB device:
            d:<devicenode>                (e.g. d:002/005)
            i:<vendor>:<product>          (e.g. i:0x0403:0x6010)
            i:<vendor>:<product>:<index>  (e.g. i:0x0403:0x6010:0)
            s:<vendor>:<product>:<serial-string>
    -I [ABCD]  connect to the specified interface on the FTDI chip
    -r  read entire flash (32Mb / 4MB) and write to file
    -R  read first 256 kB from flash and write to file
    -c  do not write flash, only verify (check)
    -b  bulk erase entire flash before writing
    -n  do not erase flash before writing
    -S  perform SRAM programming
    -t  just read the flash ID sequence
    -v  verbose output
