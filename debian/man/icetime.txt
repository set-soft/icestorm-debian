NAME

    icetime - generate timing estimates


SYNOPSIS

    icetime [OPTIONS] FILE.asc


DESCRIPTION

    Generate timing estimates from a textual bitstream file (such as
    output from arachne-pnr).


OPTIONS

    -p <pcf_file>  
        Specify PCF file to use (needed for correct IO pin names).

    -P <chip_package>  
        Specify chip package (needed for correct IO pin names).

    -g <net_index>  Write a graphviz description of the interconnect tree
        that includes the given net to 'icetime_graph.dot'.

    -o <output_file>  Write verilog netlist to the named file. Use '-'
        for stdout.

    -r <output_file>  Write timing report to the named file (instead
        of stdout).

    -d lp1k|hx1k|lp8k|hx8k  Select the device type (default = lp variant).

    -m  Enable max_span_hack for conservative timing estimates.

    -i  Only consider interior timing paths (not to/from IOs).

    -t  Print a timing estimate (based on topological timing
        analysis).

    -T <net_name>  Print a timing estimate for the specified net.

    -v  Verbose mode (print all interconnect trees).
